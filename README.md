A cloud-based choose your own adventure creator!

The goal of this project was to create a more user friendly version of the online Choose Your Own Adventure writing platforms currently available. Most of the great features available on platforms such as Twine require users to learn special syntax. It's not particularly complex syntax, but it does create a small barrier for writers learning the tool. We believe we can offer a product that is easier to use, and has a cleaner, more professional look.
